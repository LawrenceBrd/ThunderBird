ThunderBird - Lorentio Brodesco

ThunderBird is a portable device based on the Arduino UNO microcontroller, specifically the ATmega328. It originates as an idea inspired by the well-known FlipperZero, a tool that implements various devices for accessible hacking, provided one has the necessary skills.

The creation of ThunderBird stems from the high inflated cost and limited availability of the Flipper Zero. Its design has proven valuable for studying and gaining a better understanding of the original device and the operating principles of its components.

Due to its affordable price, ThunderBird cannot perform all the tasks of the FlipperZero, but it boasts the following features:
- Infrared receiver with the ability to read and replay codes.
- ESP-01 for capturing HandShakes.
- 433 MHz AM transmitter.
- Gyroscope and accelerometer.
- Integrated OLED display.
- Buzzer for audio.
- 2-axis analog joystick for menu navigation.
- 4 digital buttons (ENTER, HOME, BACK, RESET).
- Male SMA connector for connecting the 433 MHz antenna.

All of this is facilitated through user-friendly navigation with an interactive menu for choosing the desired software.
